## Video Structure

### 0:00-0:30 - Hook & Problem (30 seconds)

**Visual:**
- Show title screen: "PrediChain - Fast-Resolution Prediction Markets"
- Show problem statement on screen

**Narration:**
"Prediction markets have two critical problems preventing mainstream adoption. First, slow resolution - platforms like Augur and UMA require 24 to 48 hour resolution windows, frustrating users who want quick outcomes. Second, complex UX - gas fees and wallet management complexity prevent casual users from participating."

**Visual:**
- Show comparison: "UMA OO: 24-48 hours" vs "PrediChain: Minutes to hours"
- Show gas fee comparison: "Ethereum: $5-50" vs "BNB Chain: $0.03"

### 0:30-1:30 - Solution Overview (60 seconds)

**Visual:**
- Show PrediChain homepage
- Highlight key features on screen

**Narration:**
"We built PrediChain to solve both problems. Our platform leverages BNB Chain's Redstone oracle partnership for fast resolution - markets resolve in minutes to hours, not days. We also integrate account abstraction for gasless transactions, removing the barrier of gas fees entirely. PrediChain is focused on crypto price predictions, offering a mobile-first experience with real-time updates."

**Visual:**
- Show key differentiators:
  - "Fast Resolution: Minutes vs. Hours"
  - "Gasless UX: No Gas Fees"
  - "Crypto-Native: BTC, ETH, BNB"
  - "BNB Chain: Low Fees, Fast Finality"

### 1:30-3:30 - Live Demo (120 seconds)

**Visual:**
- Screen recording of actual application
- Show wallet connection

**Narration:**
"Let me show you how it works. First, I'll connect my wallet - you can use MetaMask, Trust Wallet, or Binance Wallet. Notice how quickly the connection happens on BNB Chain."

**Visual:**
- Connect wallet
- Show connected state

**Narration:**
"Now let's create a prediction market. I'll create a market asking: 'Will BTC price exceed $100,000 by November 18, 2025?' I select BTC as the asset, set the target price to $100,000, and choose a resolution time. Notice how the transaction is gasless - no gas fees for me as a user."

**Visual:**
- Navigate to "Create Market"
- Fill in market details
- Submit transaction
- Show transaction success (gasless)

**Narration:**
"Great! The market is created. Now let's place a trade. I'll buy a 'Yes' position for 0.1 BNB. Notice the 2% trading fee is automatically calculated and collected - this is our revenue mechanism. The transaction is again gasless."

**Visual:**
- Show market in list
- Click on market
- Buy position (Yes, 0.1 BNB)
- Show transaction (gasless)
- Highlight fee collection

**Narration:**
"Now let's resolve the market. When the resolution time arrives, the oracle provides the current BTC price. If the price is above $100,000, 'Yes' wins. If below, 'No' wins. This resolution happens in minutes, not hours or days."

**Visual:**
- Show market resolution
- Show oracle price
- Show outcome
- Show payout calculation

**Narration:**
"Winners can claim their payouts immediately. The entire process is fast, seamless, and gasless."

**Visual:**
- Claim payout
- Show success

### 3:30-4:30 - Technical Highlights (60 seconds)

**Visual:**
- Show code snippets (smart contracts)
- Show architecture diagram

**Narration:**
"Let me highlight the technical architecture. Our smart contracts are built on BNB Chain using Solidity 0.8.20 with OpenZeppelin security libraries. We use Redstone oracle for fast price resolution and integrate account abstraction for gasless transactions. The frontend is built with Next.js 14 and wagmi for Web3 interactions."

**Visual:**
- Show contract code (PredictionMarket.sol)
- Show frontend code (wagmi hooks)
- Show architecture diagram

**Narration:**
"Security is paramount - we use ReentrancyGuard, AccessControl, and comprehensive testing. All contracts are verified on BSCScan. The revenue model is clear: 2% trading fees plus premium subscriptions at $9.99 per month."

**Visual:**
- Show test results (7 passing tests)
- Show BSCScan verification (after deployment)
- Show revenue model breakdown
